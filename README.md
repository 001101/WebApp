# hc-frontend-nuxt
> uses the Nuxt.js and Express.js projects

This is the nuxt + express version of our hc-frontend as nuxt.js seams to be more stable and we have better options for keeping it updated.
 
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

### Test Login

## Backpack

We use [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).
